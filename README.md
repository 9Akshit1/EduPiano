Please make sure to have/download the latest version of pygame, numpy, wave, tkinter, shutil, music21, simpleaudio, and vedo library in python.
Remember that all music shores have to be in .XML, because I'm still working on .pig and .midi files.
Before running main.py, move the score of your choice outside all of the folders of this application. 
When running and inputting the parameters, change n_measures to 800 or above if it is a long musical piece with many notes.
